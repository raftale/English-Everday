Procrastinated for two weeks, but I've been using Duolingo to study English recently. It was quite easy at first and provided good positive feedback, so I kept at it.

Then I thought about it and realized that spoken language skills should be practiced with GPT, but I don't have much time in the coming months. It might be better to have a longer stretch of free time for consistent oral practice.

So, for now, I'll focus on memorizing vocabulary for the next two months.
